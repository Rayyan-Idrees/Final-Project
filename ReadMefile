The tutoring app requires several key functionalities for both tutors and users. Tutors and users must register securely to access the platform, and tutors can then create detailed profiles highlighting their qualifications. Users can search for tutors based on subjects and availability and book tutoring sessions accordingly. Real-time messaging facilitates communication between tutors and users, while secure payment integration ensures seamless transactions. Students can rate and review tutors after sessions, and receive notifications for updates and reminders. Administrators have access to analytics for monitoring user activity and income generation. Additionally, features such as session rescheduling, attendance tracking, progress monitoring, group tutoring, progress reports, parental controls, and offline access enhance the overall user experience and functionality of the app.
